## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Conceptual Foundation

* ðŸ“š **Learn how to apply YOLO as a powerful AI model** for the specific task of pothole detection by studying the provided reference material.
* **Familiarize yourself with the problem domain** by exploring the [Pothole Segmentation Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/farzad/pothole_segmentation_yolov8/browse?queryText=&pageSize=50&startingIndex=0&browseQuery=true), understanding its structure and the nature of the data you will be working with.

### Module 2: Model Implementation and Analysis

* **Translate theory into practice** by implementing an object detection model, preferably using the YOLOv8 framework, to identify potholes.
* **Engage in the model training and validation process**, tuning parameters and analyzing performance on the provided dataset.
* **Evaluate the model's efficacy** by testing it on new images or videos and documenting the detection results through screenshots or video clips.

### Module 3: Documentation and Submission

* **Organize your project deliverables** into a comprehensive GitHub repository. This should include your source code, the trained model weights, and a selection of your most compelling sample results.
* ðŸ“¤ **Submit your work for review** by sharing the GitHub repository link

# Intro to Data Science / ML

## Task Objectives

* _Establish a strong theoretical foundation_ in the core principles of Data Science using Python.
* _Develop a conceptual understanding_ of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving insights from real-world datasets.
* _Bridge the gap between theory and practice_ by applying learned concepts to a hands-on data project.
* _Cultivate strong documentation and communication skills_ by creating a technical summary and a professional portfolio.

---

## Course Outcomes

* **CO1:** Demonstrate a foundational and abstract understanding of the Data Science lifecycle.
* **CO2:** Understand the principles behind data preprocessing and the importance of preparing raw data for analysis.
* **CO3:** Learn to interpret data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), using statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover underlying patterns.
* **CO4:** Develop the ability to effectively communicate analytical approaches and key findings in a professional report or notebook.
* **CO5:** Appreciate the role of version control and public repositories (like GitHub) in modern data science for collaboration and portfolio development.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Theoretical Foundation
-  **Internalize core concepts** by completing the [Data Science with Python â€“ Cognitive Class](https://cognitiveclass.ai/learn/data-science-with-python) online course. 
- **understand  theoretical aspects**  of Data Science principles, which will be practically applied in the subsequent modules.

### Module 2: Practical Application: From Data to Insights
-  **Access and prepare** the [IMDB dataset](https://datasets-8yqw.onrender.com/download/fiveone) by applying theoretical knowledge of data preprocessing and cleaning.
- **Conduct** an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to grasp the dataset's intrinsic structure and characteristics.
- **Perform** a basic analysis to generate summary statistics and create visualizations, focusing on the translation of raw data into actionable insights.
- **Synthesize your findings** and methodology into a concise report or notebook (`.md` or `.pdf`) that explains your approach and conclusions.

### Module 3: Professional Practice and Submission
- **Showcase your work** by creating a GitHub repository to host your analysis report or notebook from Module 2. This demonstrates best practices in version control and project documentation.
- ðŸ“¤ **Submit your work** by sharing the GitHub repository link

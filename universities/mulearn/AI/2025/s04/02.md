# HuggingFace Deploy 

## Task Objectives

* _Master the complete lifecycle_ of a practical AI project, from initial data collection to final deployment. üöÄ
* _Develop an understanding_ of how to create and curate a custom dataset for a specific machine learning task.
* _Gain hands-on experience_ deploying a trained model as an interactive web application using industry-standard platforms.
* _Cultivate professional skills_ in building and sharing a publicly accessible AI-powered application.

---
## Course Outcomes

* **CO1:** Demonstrate the ability to programmatically gather and prepare a custom image dataset using web APIs.
* **CO2:** Apply transfer learning techniques to train an effective image classification model on a custom dataset.
* **CO3:** Understand the principles of deploying a machine learning model as a web service.
* **CO4:** Implement a user-friendly web interface for an AI model using frameworks like **Gradio** or **Streamlit**.
* **CO5:** Gain proficiency in using **Hugging Face Spaces** for hosting and sharing AI applications.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Conceptual Foundation & Data Curation
* üìö **Internalize the end-to-end workflow** by studying the methodology in [fast.ai Lesson 2](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson2.html).
* **Create your own dataset**. Choose an object you want to identify and use a tool like the DuckDuckGo Search API to programmatically collect images, forming the basis for your model's knowledge.

### Module 2: Model Training and Validation
* **Train a classifier** using the custom dataset you created. Apply transfer learning techniques to fine-tune a pre-existing neural network for your specific task.
* **Evaluate your model's performance** to ensure it can accurately identify the object of your choice.

### Module 3: Deployment and Submission
* **Build an interactive interface** for your model using either **Gradio** or **Streamlit**. This web app will allow users to upload an image and receive a prediction.
* **Deploy your application** to the world by hosting it on **Hugging Face Spaces**. 
* **Document your project** in a GitHub repository, including your code and a link to the live application.
* üì§ **Submit your work** by sharing the GitHub repository URL in the `‚Å†#ai` channel with the hashtag `#cl-ai-hfdeploy` to earn ‚≠ê **200 karma points**.

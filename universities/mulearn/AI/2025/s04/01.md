## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Conceptual Framework & Environment Setup
* ðŸ“š **Internalize the core methodology** for building a modern AI classifier by studying the [fast.ai Lesson 1](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html) tutorial.
* **Prepare your workspace** by setting up a Jupyter Notebook environment on Kaggle, the platform for our practical application.

### Module 2: Practical Application: Building the Classifier
* **Apply your understanding** by implementing the code to gather data and train your first image classification model. 
* **Analyze the model's predictive power** by testing its ability to distinguish birds from other objects.
* **Document your entire workflow**, including code, observations, and model predictions, directly within the notebook to create a comprehensive project summary.

### Module 3: Professional Practice & Submission
* **Showcase your work** by uploading the completed and polished Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) to a new GitHub repository. This demonstrates best practices in version control and portfolio management.
* ðŸ“¤ **Submit your project** by sharing your GitHub repository URL

# Basic AI Introduction

## Task Objectives

* _Give basic understanding_ of foundational topics like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL).
* _Develop practical skills_ by training a basic machine learning model using a hands-on tool.
* _Foster hands-on learning_ by applying theoretical knowledge to a practical application.
* _Strengthen technical writing and communication skills_ through the creation of a blog post and a video demonstration.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Conceptual Foundation


* üì∫ **Watch the provided [AI Basics Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcXD2UVHZ2NDPEnt6YG4lbC9_cyUx-DNk&si=Q1q8c2BPjfon6cDY)** to learn the foundational theories.
* **Identify** the core concepts in modern Artificial Intelligence as they are explained in the videos.
* **Observe** the relationships and differences between AI, ML, and DL  and other related concepts
* **Recognize** the purpose and real-world application of each field.


### Module 2: Knowledge Synthesis

* **Create content** defining _AI_, **ML**, **DL** and other related concepts
* **Develop explanations** covering the key differences and relationships between these fields.
* **Find a real-world example** for each concept to illustrate its practical application.
* **Compile this information** into a single, well-structured blog post.

### Module 3: Practical Application

* üåê **Go to** [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and start a new project.
* **Brainstorm and train** a basic model with _2 or 3 distinct classes_ (e.g., object recognition, sound classification).
* **Test** your model using live input to see how well it performs.
